Laxbets Notes:


Start virtual env:
~/Desktop/Development/laxbets: source laxbets_env/bin/activate


Make changes to DB models:
~/Desktop/Development/laxbets/laxbets_site: python manage.py makemigrations laxbets_app
if this looks good:
python manage.py migrate


Create admin:
python manage.py createsuperuser


Run Server:
python manage.py runserver



ToDo:

- manyToMany field might not be what we want?  That means it will show all possible but only highlight selected ones?
- How to display picks
- Create method to update Results after all the weeks games have been updated with winners
